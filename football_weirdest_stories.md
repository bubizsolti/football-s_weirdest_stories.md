## All Fogged Up...
Arsenal played a friendly against Dynamo Moscow in heavy fog in 1945 at White Hart Lane and despite the urging of players to suspend play due to the fog, the referee decided that play should continue.

The fog was so thick that the game turned into an absolute farce, with both sides playing by their own set of rules and suffering their own bad luck because of the inclement weather.

Moscow at one point made a substitution but didn't take a player off, with fans watching the match believing that the Russian club had up to 15 players on the pitch at the one time.

Arsenal also made the best of the conditions, with one of their players—who had earlier been sent off—sneaking back onto the pitch and playing the remainder of the game.

However, they did suffer some bad luck, with their goalkeeper knocking himself out cold after running into the goalpost, which of course, he could not see due to the fog. A spectator reportedly took his place in goals and the match continued.

## A Minute's Silence...of Sorts

A truly embarrassing moment for HFS Loans League team Congleton occurred in 1993 when holding a minute's silence before the match to mourn the death of the club's oldest fan who had reportedly passed away during week.

However, the public relations department at Congleton might want to get new sources after they were forced to cancel the minute's silence when the fan *walked into the ground* to witness the ground in his minute's silence memorial.

## Just Blow the Whistle!!

Time for some Danish football now and we pity local side Ebeltoft, who were robbed of a [deserved draw when playing Norager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEGRMBfgxCU) in the domestic competition.

Norager were leading 4-3 with seconds remaining when Ebeltoft went on the attack. As they pressed forward, however, referee Henning Erikstrup went to blow the final whistle.

Only problem was that his false teeth fell out as he went to blow the whistle—meaning that no noise came out and play continued as normal. Ebeltoft scored to make it 4-4 by the time that Erikstrup found his false teeth and put them back into his mouth.

So, 4-4 right? Mmmm. Not so much.

Erikstrup disallowed the goal and blew the final whistle, handing Norager a 4-3 win. Ebeltoft protested the match immediately following the loss and took the result to the equivalent of what is the Football Association in Denmark, but their protests were denied.

*Final score: Norager 4, Ebeltoft 3.*

## Sold for Sausages

Over to ~~Romania~~ and a side was seeking a refund after they had purchased a player not in cold hard cash but for sausage meat. Believe it or not, this included *15 kilograms* of the finest pork meat which was paid for defender Marius Cioara. At the time he was plying his trade for UT Arad who played their football in the second division. In spite of the jibes the centre back ended up retiring soon after. This was after he was unable to take any more abuse relating to this particular transfer. In fact he had to flee the country as the barrage of abuse was that much.
